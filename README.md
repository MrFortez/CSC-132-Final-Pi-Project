* What is this? 
Chop-Master Pro is an automatic food cutter. The basic idea is a 2 joint servo-controlled arm with a slicing mechanism at the top, all on a horizontal track controlled by two servos. There will additionally be a cutting board of sorts on a microwave turning motor to rotate the food. The GUI will allow the user to input various settings regarding how to cut the food, including type of cut (radial, slice, dice), number of cuts, and the size of their selected food. The code will automatically calculate the movements the arm and turntable need to do in order to cut the food properly.
