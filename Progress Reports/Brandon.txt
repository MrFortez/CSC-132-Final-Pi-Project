4.5.24
Created Progress Reports for repo

4.13.24
Started work on servos. Learned how they worked. Started research on I2C communication between Le Potato and arduino

4.17.24
Wired up the le potato to the arduino via I2C, did a lot of testing and troubleshooting to get it working,
    eventually was able to send data from the le potato to the arduino

4.27.24
Got the prototype arm, tested the arm. Found that the fishing line wasnt going to work, ordered a continuous Servo.

5.5.24
Put the updated GUI code onto the le potato, troubleshooted it and got it to work. Also switched from I2C communicaiton
    to direct USB Serial communicaiton. Managed to recognize data being sent from the Le Potato to the arduino

5.8.24
Figured out the commmunication from Le Potato to Arduino: able to read a string sent through the USB Cable. Able to take the values 
    from the GUI, put them into a String, and send it to the Arduino. Arduino is able to read the data sent and can adjust the movements
    of the Arm accordingly. Tested the newly finished rack and pinion design, as well as the arm's ability to chop.
Later in the day, we di a ton of asthetic and mechanical improvements, as the rack and pinion was very loose. Ended up breaking a piece 
    at 11.30 pm :(

5.9.24 
We 3d printed a replacement part, quickly attached it, and went to the expo.
